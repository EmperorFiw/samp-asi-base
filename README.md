# Empty ASI Loader for GTA:SA / SA-MP Client

This project is a minimal **empty ASI plugin** for **Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas** and **San Andreas Multiplayer (SA-MP) client**.  

## Purpose

- Basic template for creating your own ASI plugin.
- No built-in features except a demo for toggling Infinite Run by pressing F3.
- Ideal starting point for developers who want to build custom ASI plugins from scratch.

## Example Feature

- Press **F3** during gameplay to toggle Infinite Run.

## How to Use

1. Build the project to generate the `.asi` file.
2. Place the `.asi` file into your GTA San Andreas root directory.
3. Launch the game or SA-MP client; the ASI plugin will load and run the example code.
4. Press **F3** while playing to toggle Infinite Run on/off.

## Requirements

- Visual Studio 2017 or later (recommended) with C++14 or newer support
